    "<h2>About this material</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the core material of the online course Basic Python for Log Analysis, given at the Universidad Simon Bolivar (USB) AAPG Student Chapter (Caracas, Venezuela), in January 2021.  It was created and given by Manuel David Soto (MSc in Geology, University of Texas at Austin, USA), with organization of Ulises Berman (Student of Geophysical Eng, USB, Caracas, Venezuela), President of the USB AAPG student chapter. In the course participated 25 students and professionals from six countries; Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, USA, and Venezuela the organizer country.\n",

    "<h2>Objectives</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Log analysis (LA) or petrophysics is the geosciences discipline that integrate and interpret all the data acquired in the initial live of the wells. Python (programing language) and its different libraries (both free) provide extraordinary and scalable tools for log analysis and other geosciences disciplines. The course covers basic tools (loading and writing information, plotting, basic statistics, execution of function and formulas, summaries, regressions, â€¦) of this general-porpoise programming language with direct application in LA. The participants have to do reinforcement homework exercises after every session.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Format</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is composed by an introduction (pdf not provided here) and 3 online sessions of 2 hours and 45 minutes (15 minutes break). Before session 1, the participants have to read the introduction and installed Python and Jupyter Notebook according to the instructions given in the introduction. Installation problems cannot be tackled during the sessions. Each session has a folder with its corresponding data, images, and Jupyter Notebooks (theory and exercises). Along the course, Jupyter Notebook is the environment that we use to develop our Python codes. The exercises are shown in all theoretical Notebooks (Session_1_variables_data_arrays_functions.ipynb) however, it is recommended to work the exercises in the Notebook intended just for that (Session_1_exercises.ipynb), in that way the theoretical Notebook is preserved for future references.\n",
